## Description
For this collection I wanted to dive into the world of PFPs and create an entity with a projected personality. That entity is Mookie and that personality is yours. Now go. There is a 12,000 total supply on the original (free mint - go for it) and 3,333 each on S3 and S3-PS. These will mint as the first lots sell to fund the next batches. The more you buy the more Mookie can breed ... help Mookie breed.
